📁 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sales analysis using SQL Server. It involves creating a database, designing tables, inserting data manually, and running analytical queries to extract useful business insights.

📂 Work Completed

✅ 1. Created the Database
A new database named SalesAnalysisDB was created to store all related sales data.

✅ 2. Designed and Created Tables
Two main tables were created:

sales – to store transaction-level sales data (product ID, quantity, price, discount, etc.)

product_details – to store product-related metadata (product name, segment, etc.)

✅ 3. Inserted Sample Records
Sample records were inserted manually using .sql file scripts.

This included inserting at least 10+ sample rows into each table for testing queries.

✅ 4. Performed Data Analysis
Various queries were written and executed to analyze the data.

Analysis included:

Total quantity sold.

Segment-wise product performance.

Revenue and discount calculations.

Identifying top-selling products.

Summary reports based on product segments.

✅ 5. Captured Screenshots
Screenshots were taken for:

Database creation

Table creation

Data insertion

Query results

✅ 6. Practiced SQL Joins
Successfully implemented inner joins to combine data from multiple tables for better analysis.

✅ 7. Learned SQL Window Functions
Used advanced SQL concepts like ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION BY and ORDER BY to identify top-performing products within each segment.

📌 Purpose of the Project
To practice real-time SQL skills and understand how to perform data analysis directly using structured queries in SQL Server. This helps in developing insights from raw data stored in relational tables.
